<h2>My Critique</h2>
<p>
When I first opened the site, the load time was almost instantaneous, there was no issue at all with loading it.  My first impression is that it was interesting and eye catching without being too busy.  There are interesting
graphics and product shots that look nice and make me interested in learning more about the products.  Overall, I am impressed from the beginning.
</p>
<p>
As far as organization goes, the main homepage is dedicated to new products being highlighted, recipes and stories related to current events and promotions.  The text is mainly centered with most of the links available in
a dropdown menu that is located to the right of the main information.  The structure is pretty standard for modern sites, I don't find it confusing at all.  If I was looking for a specific product or even ideas for a specific
meal, the site has sections for that.
</p>
<p>
There are quite a few graphics and product images used on the site, however I find them to not be distracting.  Instead, I feel like they do a good job of guiding the viewer's eye throughout the site and highlighitng important
products and information in an appealing way.  I would say they definitely enhance the appeal of the site.  The use of text and background color as well is great, with fonts and colors that do not stand out in a bad way.
I will say one thing that I can critique is that the actual font they use is a bit generic.  For a store and website that has a lot of personality in the visuals, seeing that generic font came off as a bit bland to me.
That being said, I would rather have bland and professional font, than distracting and weird.  The color scheme also seems to be standard across all the different Trader Joe's sites.
</p>
<p>
As far as navigation goes, the menu I mentioned previously is the main way to navigate the site and it works well, it's broken down with subheadings and graphics to help lead you in the right direction.  There is also a
large "Search" and "Shopping List" function at the top which are easy to use.  I also tested how responsive the site is by changing the size of the window.  It adapted to the size of the window, keeping things readable, which
works well.  That being said, I feel like the site looks best full screen.
</p>
<p>
Overall, I feel like Trader Joe's has a well designed site.  It looks good and is easy to navigate, while also having some interesting quirky designs that make it stand out and matches the unique vibe of the actual store.
Aside from some of the graphics, there isn't anything that super stood out to me compared to other shopping sites I've used, but that's not a bad thing.  It does its job well.

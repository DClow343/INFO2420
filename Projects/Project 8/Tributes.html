<p>My favorite past time is cooking.  I especially like cooking for family and friends.  I was glad to find this web site about Native Cooking of Utah.</p>
<p>I like to make sure the items I choose to cook meet the needs of my target audience.  I have found the recipes in this collection to be wildly popular with my Utah neighbors and family members.</p>
<p>My family especially loves the raspberry cake recipe.  I am enclosing a photo of my version of the cake.</p>
<p>Thanks for adding spice to my cooking,</p>

<p>My name is Daisy Daniels and I have enjoyed using the recipes I have found at your web site.</p>
<p>I thought I already knew how to cook like a Utahan, but I have been able to expand my repertoire after trying out some of your more unusual offerings.</p>
<p>I like how these recipes are inexpensive to prepare, and they serve lots of people.  The clean up usually is painless as well.</p>
<p>I loved your green jello recipe.  My family makes sure we never have leftovers when I fix this one.</p>
<p>Thanks for everything,</p>

<p>Whenever I am at a loss about what to cook for dinner, I just go to your web site and I can always find an answer.</p>
<p>The ingredients of your recipes are always reasonably priced so I won't have to worry about busting my budget.</p>
<p>I was nervous about trying to make my own ice cream, but your Bear Lake Raspberry recipe made me brave enough to try it.</p>
<p>The step by step directions were easy to follow and my kids really loved the ice cream.  I am attaching a photo.</p>
<p>I scream for your ice cream,</p>

<p id="DutchOven">Real men are not afraid to try Dutch oven cooking.  I made an investment in equipment, but it sat in my garage until I found your wonderful recipes online.</p>
<p>Now, I am a hit at family reunions and campouts.  I have tried main dishes, deserts, and even baked rolls.  My next attempt will be lasagna.</p>
<p>Thanks for giving me the courage to try cooking the old fashioned way.</p>
<p>Warmly yours,</p>
